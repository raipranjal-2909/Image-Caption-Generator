Image Caption Generator

Overview
The Image Caption Generator is a machine learning-based project designed to automatically generate descriptive captions for images. By leveraging convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image feature extraction and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, for caption generation, this project aims to produce accurate and meaningful descriptions for a variety of images.


Features
Automatic generation of image captions
Pre-trained models for quick setup and testing
Support for custom datasets
Evaluation metrics to measure caption quality
